+Use it to send BUZZ and other stuff like that.
```


Iahu shows in a classic real time chat application the usage of web sockets. U can create rooms and the people present there will see ur messages and will be
notified if u leave.

It generates a random name for you, a pretty funny one if u ask me, and it uses cookies to store your settings, like the sound setting. When that is off u won't 
hear BUZZ's or new chat notifications.

Everything is real time made, even the automatic checking for new rooms. Wanted to implement some sort of mafia game, but i'd need about 7 more hours lmao.
Feel free to do whatever u want with the code, if u like Node.js be my guest.

Also if any1 reading this has a project in their mind, i'd love joining a team and other shit like that. UBB rules.

Also make sure to check <a href = 'https://racnetulcarpatilor.ro' target='_blank'>Racnetul Carpatilor</a>, I'd appreaciate someone seeing my bad jokes :)

```diff
-Technical details
```
Iahu runs on Node.js, more precisely node v13.12.0, but that does not really matters.
Node.js is also faimous for its chat capabilities, thus me choosing it.

```diff
!To run locally
```
Install node.js, npm
then get the project locally, go to the root folder and then do: npm install

After node modules are up, do: nodemon start

good luck have fun
